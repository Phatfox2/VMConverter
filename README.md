## Explanation ##
This is project 7 in the [nand2tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course). The task was to create a program in any choice language
as you can see, I picked javascript, and to be able to read lines from a program, and convert them to nand2tetris's hack assembly language.
## Utilization ##
I used node.js mainly to accomplish this. 
## Other ##
Note that this is a continuation and that there are many more programs like this in the nand2tetris project page. All credits to nand2tetris for making the projects.
